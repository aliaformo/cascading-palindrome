# 🎓 Implementing a Cascading Palindrome

## 📚 This is a task for Zuri

### 📝 Instructions

Implement a cascading palindrome - a cascading palindrome in the context of this task means the following:

1. The class takes a parameter with several components. The parameter could be a word, a sentence, multiple numbers, etc. The parameter contains various items separated by space.
2. The class determines the part of the parameter that is a palindrome and returns only the palindrome part of the parameter.
For clarity, consider these examples:

a. 1230321  returns 1230321

b. 1230321 09234 0124210 returns 1230321 0124210

c. abcd5dcba 1230321 09234 0124210 returns abcd5dcba 1230321 0124210

You can assume that the example structure above will always be the case for this task. For example, this sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal – Panama" is a palindrome; however, you don't need to consider such a case in your implementation.

While implementing a palindrome or even a cascading palindrome could be considered easy, the difficulty is efficiency. Your code needs to consider the following:

1. Efficiency: Use as little memory as possible
2. Speed: Ensure the fastest result regardless of how many components the parameter has
3. Validation: validation data given by users and return appropriate responses if invalid data is given
4. Error handling: return appropriate error messages when something goes wrong.
